# Plugin System Extensions

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Plugin UI Integration
The system SHALL integrate plugin user interfaces seamlessly into the main desktop application using micro-frontend technology.

#### Scenario: Plugin route loading
- **WHEN** user selects a plugin from the navigation
- **THEN** the plugin's main route is loaded in the central container via Wujie
- **AND** the plugin operates with isolated DOM and JavaScript context
- **AND** plugin loading states are displayed during initialization

#### Scenario: Plugin settings page embedding
- **WHEN** user accesses plugin settings
- **THEN** the plugin's settings interface is embedded in the main application
- **AND** settings changes are persisted through the plugin API
- **AND** settings validation occurs within the plugin context

### Requirement: Plugin Installation Management
The system SHALL provide user-friendly plugin installation and management capabilities through the desktop interface.

#### Scenario: Local plugin import
- **WHEN** user selects a local plugin file for installation
- **THEN** the plugin manifest is validated for compatibility
- **AND** plugin dependencies are checked against available APIs
- **AND** installation proceeds with user confirmation and progress indication

#### Scenario: Plugin enable/disable control
- **WHEN** user toggles plugin enabled state
- **THEN** the plugin is activated or deactivated in the plugin manager
- **AND** plugin UI elements are added or removed from navigation
- **AND** plugin background processes are started or stopped accordingly

### Requirement: Plugin Lifecycle UI Feedback
The system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for plugin states and operations through the desktop interface.

- **AND** the plugin can be reloaded or disabled from the interface
- **AND** error details are logged for debugging purposes

### Requirement: Plugin API Bridge Enhancement
The system SHALL extend the existing plugin API bridge to support UI integration and enhanced plugin management.

#### Scenario: UI-specific API exposure
- **WHEN** plugins request UI-related capabilities
- **THEN** the API bridge provides controlled access to navigation updates
- **AND** plugins can register custom menu items or shortcuts
- **AND** UI operations are sandboxed to prevent interference with core interface

#### Scenario: Plugin metadata management
- **WHEN** plugins are installed or updated
- **THEN** plugin metadata (name, version, description, icon) is managed by the bridge
- **AND** metadata is used for navigation display and plugin identification
- **AND** metadata validation ensures consistency and security
