## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: QR Code Authentication
The system SHALL provide QR code-based authentication for ACFun accounts to enable secure login without exposing credentials to the renderer process.

#### Scenario: QR code generation and display
- **WHEN** user initiates login process
- **THEN** system generates a unique QR code and displays it in the UI
- **AND** QR code contains secure authentication challenge

#### Scenario: Successful authentication
- **WHEN** user scans QR code with ACFun mobile app and confirms
- **THEN** system receives authentication token
- **AND** token is securely stored in main process only
- **AND** user interface updates to show logged-in state

#### Scenario: Authentication timeout
- **WHEN** QR code expires without being scanned
- **THEN** system generates a new QR code automatically
- **AND** user interface updates with the new QR code

### Requirement: Secure Token Management
The system SHALL manage authentication tokens securely, ensuring they are never exposed to the renderer process or plugins.

#### Scenario: Token storage
- **WHEN** authentication is successful
- **THEN** tokens are encrypted and stored in main process memory
- **AND** tokens are persisted to secure storage for session recovery

#### Scenario: Token refresh
- **WHEN** access token approaches expiration
- **THEN** system automatically refreshes token using refresh token
- **AND** new tokens are stored securely without user intervention

#### Scenario: Token invalidation
- **WHEN** user logs out or token becomes invalid
- **THEN** all stored tokens are cleared from memory and storage
- **AND** user interface returns to login state

### Requirement: Authentication Status Synchronization
The system SHALL synchronize authentication status between main process and renderer to provide consistent user experience.

#### Scenario: Login status broadcast
- **WHEN** authentication status changes
- **THEN** main process broadcasts status to renderer via IPC
- **AND** renderer updates UI to reflect current status

#### Scenario: Session recovery
- **WHEN** application starts with valid stored tokens
- **THEN** system automatically restores authenticated state
- **AND** user interface shows logged-in state without requiring re-authentication
