# Enhance Plugin System

## Why

The current plugin system provides basic installation, management, and configuration capabilities, but lacks several advanced features that would significantly improve the developer and user experience. These missing features include plugin pop-up systems, overlay page generation, Node Worker hosting, complete lifecycle management, lightweight console access, advanced plugin features, and performance optimizations.

## What Changes

- **Plugin Pop-up System**: Add support for plugins to create modal dialogs and pop-up windows for user interactions
- **Overlay Page Generation**: Enable plugins to generate overlay pages that can be displayed on top of the main application
- **Node Worker Plugin Hosting**: Implement Node.js Worker-based plugin execution environment for better isolation and performance
- **Complete Plugin Lifecycle Management**: Add comprehensive lifecycle hooks (install, enable, disable, update, uninstall) with proper event handling
- **Lightweight Console**: Provide mobile/tablet-friendly console interface for plugin management
- **Advanced Plugin Features**: Implement hot reload, version management, dependency resolution, and plugin marketplace integration
- **Performance Optimizations**: Add memory pools, connection pools, and other performance enhancements for plugin operations

## Impact

- Affected specs: plugin-system, desktop-ui
- Affected code: 
  - `packages/main/src/plugin/PluginManager.ts` - Core plugin management
  - `packages/renderer/src/components/plugin/` - Plugin UI components
  - `packages/main/src/ipc/ipcHandlers.ts` - IPC communication
  - `packages/preload/src/index.ts` - Preload API exposure
  - New files for Worker hosting, overlay system, and mobile console
